        <p>The Battle of Stalingrad was a major turning point in World War II. Fought between July 1942 and February 1943, it was one of the largest and bloodiest battles in the history of warfare. Stalingrad, now known as Volgograd, was a strategically important city in the Soviet Union, located on the Volga River. 
          The German army sought to capture the city as part of their effort to defeat the Soviet Union and secure control of the oil fields in the Caucasus. 
          However, this is not why Hitler wanted to take the city. He simply wanted the city due to it being named after his arch rival and leader of the Soviet Union, 
          Josef Stalin, and wanted to embarrass him in defeat. This proved to be a fatal error to the German war machines effort into conquering all.</p>
