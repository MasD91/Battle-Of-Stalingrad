        1. The first page that visitors are greeted with is the background page to kick them off with a little bit of history as to how the event started.
        2. The main points are clearly explained on each page.
        3. The user should navigate the nav bar as it shows to receive the information in chronological order.

    2. They should also be also to easily navigate through the different pages internally and externally.

        1. The site has been designed so that every internal page is easily accessible from the nav bar.
        2. The site also has the external links in the footer to be easily accessible also.

    3. They should also be able to visit appropriate external sites within the community. 

        1. The social media links can be found in the footer of every page.
        2. Once the visitors access each social media page they will find more information on the event and be able to speak to others in the community

-   #### Frequent User Goals

    1. Frequent users should be able to subscribe to an e-newsletter to further their thirst for knowledge.  

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and will know how to navigate to the sign up page.
        2. Once they are here they will be met with the subscribe section which they will give them access to the e-newsletter.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
