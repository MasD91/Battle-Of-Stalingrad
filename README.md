### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

- #### First Time Visitor Goals
  1. First time visitors should be able to see that the purpose of this page is to educate and inform.
     - The first page that visitors are greeted with is the background page to kick them off with a little bit of history as to how the event started.
       ![Greeting info](assets/gallery/greeting.jpg)
     - The main points are clearly explained on each page.
       ![Main points](assets/gallery/main-points.jpg)
     - The user should navigate the nav bar as it shows to receive the information in chronological order.
       ![Chronological order](assets/gallery/chron-order.jpg)
  2. They should also be able to easily navigate through the different pages internally and externally.
     - The site has been designed so that every internal page is easily accessible from the nav bar.
       ![Navigation-bar](assets/gallery/nav-bar.jpg)
     - The site also has the external links in the footer to be easily accessible.
       ![External Links](assets/gallery/ext-links.jpg)

- #### Returning Visitor Goals
  1. Returning visitors should be able to easily access different stages of the historical event.
     - These are clearly shown in the navigation bar.
  2. Returning visitors should be able to give feedback on the information provided and also be able to ask questions.
     - The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Sign Up" Page.
     - Here the visitors will be shown a place where they can give open, unlimited feedback.
       ![External Links](assets/gallery/feedback.jpg)
  3. They should also be able to visit appropriate external sites within the community.
     - The social media links can be found in the footer of every page.
     - Once the visitors access each social media page, they will find more information on the event and be able to speak to others in the community.

- #### Frequent User Goals
  1. Frequent users should be able to subscribe to an e-newsletter to further their thirst for knowledge.
     - The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and will know how to navigate to the sign-up page.
     - Once they are here, they will be met with the subscribe section, which will give them access to the e-newsletter.

- Pages were tested regularly to ensure all links and media work.
- Friends and family members were asked to review the site to help with design and errors to see if anything was missed.

### Known Bugs
