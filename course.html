        <h2>Course of the Battle</h2>
        <p>The battle was fought between the German 6th Army and elements of the Soviet 62nd and 64th Armies.
          Stalin had ordred all civilians living in the city to stay put and made it illegal for them to leave the city with the punishment of death.
          Soldiers on both sides faced numerous dangers, including artillery and mortar fire, sniper attacks, close-quarters combat, and harsh weather conditions.
          The harsh conditions, combined with the ferocity of the fighting, meant that the life expectancy for a soldier in Stalingrad was extremely low. Estimates vary, but it is believed that the average lifespan of a soldier on the front lines was only a few weeks.
          The fighting was brutal and intense, with control of the city constantly changing hands. 
          Eventually, whilst the german army thought the battle was almost over in thier favour, the Soviets were able to encircle the German army with what is known as one of the greatest counter-offences of all time.</p>
